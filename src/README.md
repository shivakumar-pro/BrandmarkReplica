/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {

  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Add Tailwind directives to your CSS:
Create a CSS file (e.g., src/index.css) and add the following lines to include Tailwind's base, components, and utilities:

css

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Import the CSS file in your project:
Open src/index.js (or src/index.tsx if using TypeScript) and import the CSS file:

js

import './index.css';
